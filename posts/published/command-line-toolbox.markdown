Having recently read through [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/97_Things_Every_Programmer_Should_Know), I have spent some time thinking about what I would like to become better at as a programmer.
The book is a collection of short essays written by experienced programmers.
The essays discuss concepts and skills important for anyone working with software development, some teaching a certain mindset or attitude, others with more practical suggestions.

A couple of the essays, namely [Know How to Use Command-line Tools](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Know_How_to_Use_Command-line_Tools) by Carroll Robinson and [The Unix Tools Are Your Friends](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Unix_Tools_Are_Your_Friends) by Diomidis Spinellis, advocate the power of the command line.
Although I've been using Linux for many years now, I didn't feel like I had really tapped the power of the command line.
Thus, inspired by these essays, I decided it was time to get to know the tools of my command line better.

These are my working notes---a summary of my new toolbox.s

The Basics
------------

Before taking on the real powertools of the command line, I wanted to make sure I had all my basics covered.
For this, I skimmed through the [Linux fundamentals](http://www.funtoo.org/wiki/Linux_Fundamentals,_Part_1) tutorials.
This four-part tutorial covers the broad basics of using the Linux terminal.
Although I were more or less familiar with most of the topics, I picked up a lot of details along the way.

Part 1 simply explains the most basic commands.
Part 2 is entitled *basic administration* and covers topics such as regular expressions, the file system, processes, pipes and the kernel.
In part 3..
Part 4..

The tutorials are well written, and teaches the basics of Linux well.
